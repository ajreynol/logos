"""Check a generated parser configuration against the generated signature.

`Cpc/Parser.lean` is auto-generated from the same Eunoia signature as
`Cpc/Logos.lean`.  This script re-derives from the signature the facts the
generator has to get right, and fails if the parser table disagrees:

  * every operator of the signature is represented by at least one surface
    declaration;
  * a surface name does not represent the same operator more than once;
  * every proof rule of the calculus is named exactly once.

An operator may occur under more than one surface name.  In particular, a
signature `define` introduces an alias whose generated parser entry references
the same internal operator as its original declaration.

Surface arities such as Eunoia's `:arg-list` are explicit declaration metadata;
they cannot be reconstructed from the generated term types and are exercised by
the generic parser tests instead.

Usage: scripts/check-parser-tables.py [Cpc ...]
